She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning                         :: a
Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind                                   :: G a
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking                    :: a
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win                    :: G a

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah                                                    :: a G a G a

She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men                :: a
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or God               :: G a
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies                    :: a
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life                          :: G a

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah                                                    :: a G a G a

But she wouldn't think of battle that reduces men to animals                  :: a
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end                                    :: G a
For she's the mother of all men who counseled me so wisely then               :: a
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay                      :: G a

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah                                                    :: a G a G a

"Oh lady lend your hand," I cried "And let me rest here at your side."        :: a
"Have faith and trust in peace," she said, and filled my heart with life      :: G a
"There is no strength in numbers have no such misconception                   :: a
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away."                         :: G a

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah                                                    :: a G a G a

Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say          :: a
I stood and watched until I saw her black coat disappear                      :: G a
My labour is no easier but now I know I'm not alone                           :: a
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day                        :: G a
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise           :: a
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me                      :: G a

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah                                                    :: a G a G a
